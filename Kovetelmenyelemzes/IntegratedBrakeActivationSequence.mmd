    Note over ED,BCS: Monitoring for Events
    ED->>BCS: Data from Radar, LiDAR, Camera
    BCS->>CBF: Initiate Brake Force Calculation
    CBF->>Brakes: Brake Pressure & Wheel Speed Data
    Brakes->>BCS: Initial Brake Force Ready
    BCS->>Cor: Assess for Corrections
    Cor->>BCS: Corrections from IMU, Steering Angle, Environmental Data
    BCS->>Act: Determine Activation Mode
    Act->>Brakes: Activate Braking Systems (BAS, TCS, ABS, EBD)
    Brakes-->>BCS: Braking Activated
