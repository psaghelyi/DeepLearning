 next steps:

1. **Encoder and Decoder Model Definition**:
   - Define your CNN encoder (possibly using a pre-trained model like ResNet) and sequence-based decoder (RNN, LSTM, or Transformer).
   - Implement an attention mechanism in your decoder if desired.

2. **Loss Function and Optimizer**:
   - Define the appropriate loss function (typically cross-entropy loss for caption generation).
   - Choose an optimizer (like Adam or SGD) and set its parameters.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Implement the training loop, including forward pass, loss computation, backpropagation, and optimization steps.
   - Include validation steps to monitor the model's performance on unseen data.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Use the BLEU score to evaluate the quality of generated captions on the validation set.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Optimization**:
   - Experiment with different hyperparameters to improve model performance.
   - Try techniques to combat overfitting, such as dropout or data augmentation.

6. **Test Set Predictions and Submission Preparation**:
   - Once satisfied with the model's performance, generate captions for the test set.
   - Format the predictions into a CSV file for submission as per the guidelines.
